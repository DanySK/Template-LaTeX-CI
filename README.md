# LaTeX template repository with continuous integration  

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanySK/Template-LaTeX-CI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DanySK/Template-LaTeX-CI)

This repository is meant to be used as template for quickly starting LaTeX projects,
having them built on a continuous integrator, and having them quickly deployed in GitHub releases.

The build system is based on Gradle, using [the latex-gradle plugin](https://github.com/DanySK/gradle-latex).

The file being built is a LaTeX quick reference by [Mark Gates](http://www.icl.utk.edu/~mgates3/), kudos to him.
