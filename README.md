# LaTeX template repository with continuous integration  

This repository is meant to be used as template for quickly starting LaTeX projects,
having them built on a continuous integrator, and having them quickly deployed in GitHub releases.

The build system is based on Gradle, using [the latex-gradle plugin](https://github.com/DanySK/gradle-latex).
